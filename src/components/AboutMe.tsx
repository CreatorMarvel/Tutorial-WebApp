					I am a patient and dedicated tutor with a strong passion for
					Mathematics, Science, and Technology. My tutoring journey began in
					high school, where I discovered my love for teaching. Over the years,
					Iâ€™ve helped many students succeed, each with unique learning needs
					<br />
					<br />
					With a medical studies background, I have in-depth knowledge of
					Biology, Chemistry, and other sciences. I excel at simplifying complex
					concepts, making them easy to understand for my students
					<br />
					<br />
					Outside of tutoring, I enjoy playing guitar, coding, and solving
					challenging math and coding problems. These hobbies keep me sharp and
					fuel my passion for learning
